## Story
### INSPIRATION
Everyone needs to learn to code. Coding is a skill that serves as building block for achieving an incredible amount of things in this world. Teaching everyone to code will enable people to think in new ways, shift their world view and be empower to build and change the world that is around them.
This project was inspired by a recent Mixed Reality Hackathon. 
MakeCode is a great interactive coding environment, but it could be even more engaging if you could move blocks of code with your hands and have a truly immersive experience, building and executing code.
I can see this becoming an afternoon program in schools and communities world wide, meetups and Saturday coding sessions. There could also be week long summer sessions, allowing students to dive deeper and build more meaningful experiences.
 
## HOW IT WILL WORK / HOW IT WILL BE BUILT

### Scenario 1: 
A student will be able to use their hands to order blocks of code. These code blocks could be used to create a melody or direct a virtual robot to move around. Once the blocks of code are aligned, the student can tap the sequence and watch it work, like putting together an interactive puzzle. The out come could be melody, or having a robot turn in a circle, wave, or sit down. This could be extended to allow a student to build a robot pet, design a race car, train or airplane. All using blocks of code that would be picked up and moved around.
 
### Scenario 2: 
2 or more people can now get involved. This allows student to connect in a virtual world and begin creating together, they can each plug and play blocks of code and work collaboratively to build more elaborate examples.
 
### Scenario 3: 
Pulling it all together and using the AR environment to control and program a real life robot in the students room. We would leverage cognitive services to create a natural language interface to improve the students ability to find the code snippets they want to use or find the blocks of code and move them around.
